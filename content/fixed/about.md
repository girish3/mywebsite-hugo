## Who am I?
My name is Girish Budhwani, based out of Bangalore, India. I did my Bachelor's from IIT Jodhpur, currently working as a Software Developer at Microsoft.

## Why SportyGeek? 
Well, it best describes me. I was actually born as a sportsman who
was forced to study (the story of half of Indians). Nevertheless, I am glad that
I did my graduation in Computer Science. Now coding and sports help me
get out of bed in the morning. I have played Tennis and Cricket at college level, 
won a couple of medals. Currently playing Snooker and TT at office and 
Football on the weekends. I also love travelling and have visited six countries.

<strong>John:</strong> Come on, guys. Take a lesson from an old man. Don't spend it. Invest. </br>
<strong>Left Ear:</strong> In what?</br> 
<strong>John:</strong> In gold.</br> 
<strong>Left Ear:</strong> What are you getting, Rob?</br> 
<strong>Rob:</strong> I'll get the Aston Martin Vanquish and I'm just thinking about naked girls in leather seats.</br> 
<strong>Lyle:</strong> I'm gonna get a big stereo. Speakers so loud, they blow women's clothes off.</br> 
<strong>Left Ear:</strong> Thirty-five million dollars, you can't get more creative than that, man? I'm going to Andalusia. The south of Spain. Right over there. Get me a big house, get me a library full of first editions, get a room for my shoes... What about you, Steve? </br>
<strong>Steve:</strong> I liked what you said. I'll take one of each of yours. <br>
